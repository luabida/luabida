My name has an [ã](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%83), which can be a bit hard to pronounce depending on the language. In portuguese we use nasal syllables in many words, for instance, the word 'No' is '[Não](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwS8GMDHUtM)'. And thus these sounds are not pronounced in english, it is understandable that 'Luã' (路安) may be pronounced as 'Lua'.
